# What is this?
This repository shall contain the most useful but also the most minimal version of information available in websites connected to BME in any level.

- Use links whenever possible
	- Post original link, but [web archive](https://web.archive.org/) it before
- Use one paragraph per event
	- Header: [event name1/event name2/.../event nameN] ([Year]. [Month]. ["eleje" or "közepe" or "vége" or "első fele" or "második fele"])
		- Years are counted from start of summer until the next start of summer
		- Years can be omited if the event is reoccuring
		- If Month or Year spans across another of its type then use [Subject]-[Subject].
		- If event happens in another event (so they are closely related) then just name that event's name in the brackets. (therefore omit Year, Month, ...)
	- Body
